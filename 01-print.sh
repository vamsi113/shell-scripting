## problems raised while shell- scripting:
#Ensured the script should run only if it is a root user/sudo previleges. --- sol run with sudo permissions
#if any command is a failure then i need to stop the script there and then --- sol -conditions
#rather than printing 0 and 1 or  something i printed success or failure  --- sol -- conditions
#re-run of automation should never fail
